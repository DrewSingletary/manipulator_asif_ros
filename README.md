This is the simulation environment for testing control barrier functions on manipulators. Developed on ROS Melodic, and tested on Noetic.

### Installation: ###
First, install the asif library (https://github.com/DrewSingletary/asif)
Also requires Boost and Eigen (some versions will cause conflicts when integrating Eigen types, will remove Eigen dependency in the integrator soon.)
Then, install as you would install any ROS package
