This is the simulation environment for testing control barrier functions on manipulators. Developed on ROS Melodic, and tested on Noetic.

### Installation: ###
First, install the asif library (https://github.com/DrewSingletary/asif) and Pinocchio (https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio)
Also requires Boost and Eigen (some versions will cause conflicts when integrating Eigen types, will remove Eigen dependency in the integrator soon.)
Then, install as you would install any ROS package

### Important: ###
Change the filepath in the common.h header file to be your path, will make local soon.
